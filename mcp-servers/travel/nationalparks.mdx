## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Exceeded" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Error Message:**

```
429 Too Many Requests - API rate limit exceeded
```

    **Cause:** You've exceeded 1,000 requests per hour

    **Solutions:**
    - Wait until the next hour for your limit to reset (hourly rate limits)
    - Space out your requests over time in Studio conversations
    - Batch related requests in single prompts: "Tell me about Yosemite and check for alerts"
    - Reduce the number of parks you're querying simultaneously

    **To check your usage:**
    1. Go to Studio Settings → MCP Servers
    2. Click on National Parks
    3. View API usage metrics

    <Tip>
      Studio shows real-time API usage. The 1,000 requests/hour limit is generous for most use cases.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid API Key" icon="key">
    **Error Message:**

```
401 Unauthorized - Invalid API key
```

    **Cause:** API key is missing, incorrect, expired, or revoked

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify your API key in Studio server settings (no extra spaces)
    - Ensure you copied the entire API key from the email
    - Request a new API key from [nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm)
    - Check your email for any revocation notices

    **To update in Studio:**
    1. Settings → MCP Servers → National Parks
    2. Click **Edit Configuration**
    3. Paste new API key in NPS_API_KEY field
    4. Click **Save**
    5. Test with: "Tell me about Yellowstone"

    **Common Mistakes:**
    - Extra spaces before/after the API key when pasting
    - Copying only part of the API key from the email
    - Using an API key from a different NPS account

    <Info>
      Studio validates your API key automatically when you save. You'll see a success message if it's correct.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Park Not Found" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Error Message:**

```
Park not found or invalid park code
```

    **Cause:** Invalid or non-existent park code provided

    **Solutions:**
    - Use `findParks` tool to search for the correct park code by name
    - Verify the park code format (usually 4 lowercase letters, e.g., "yose", "grca")
    - Check if the location is actually a National Park (not a state park or other designation)
    - Try searching by full park name instead of abbreviation
    - Refer to the park code appendix at the bottom of this page

    **Examples of Correct Park Codes:**
    - Yosemite: `yose` (not YOSE or yosemite)
    - Grand Canyon: `grca` (not grand-canyon)
    - Yellowstone: `yell` (not yellow)
    - Great Smoky Mountains: `grsm` (not smoky-mountains)

    **Tip:** When in doubt, use `findParks` with a search term: "Find parks matching Yosemite"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid State Code" icon="map-location-dot">
    **Error Message:**

```
Invalid state code(s): XY
```

    **Cause:** Invalid US state code provided in search filters

    **Solutions:**
    - Use standard two-letter US state codes (e.g., "CA", "NY", "TX")
    - Ensure state codes are uppercase (though the server converts them)
    - Verify comma-separated format for multiple states: "CA,OR,WA" (no spaces)
    - Check for typos in state abbreviations

    **Valid State Code Examples:**
    - California: `CA`
    - New York: `NY`
    - Texas: `TX`
    - Multiple states: `CA,OR,WA` or `UT,AZ,CO`

  <Accordion title="Server Not Responding" icon="server">
    **Error Message:**

```
Server is not responding
```
or
```
Failed to connect to MCP server
```

    **Cause:** Network connectivity issue or server temporarily unavailable

    **Solutions:**
    - Check your internet connection
    - Verify the server is enabled in Studio (Settings → MCP Servers)
    - Try disabling and re-enabling the server in Studio

    **Quick Fix in Studio:**
    1. Go to **Settings** → **MCP Servers**
    2. Find "National Parks" in the list
    3. Toggle it **Off**, wait 5 seconds
    4. Toggle it **On** again

    <Info>
      Studio manages all server infrastructure automatically - there's no local setup or Docker containers to troubleshoot. If issues persist, check your API key validity at https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm

  <Accordion title="Empty or Missing Data" icon="circle-question">
    **Error Message:**

```
No data available
```
or fields return null/empty arrays

    **Cause:** Data not available for the requested resource

    **Possible Reasons:**
    - Park doesn't have any current alerts (this is good!)
    - No upcoming events scheduled in the specified date range
    - Visitor centers or campgrounds closed for the season
    - Park code is valid but specific resource type not available
    - Search query too restrictive (no matches found)

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify the park code is correct using `getParkDetails`
    - Expand date range for event searches
    - Check if facilities are seasonal (many close in winter)
    - Remove or adjust search filters (`q` parameter)
    - Try a different, more established park as a test
    - Use broader search criteria or remove activity filters

    **Note:** Empty results are normal for some queries (e.g., parks with no current alerts is expected and positive)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow Response Times" icon="clock">
    **Symptoms:**
    - Requests taking longer than 5-10 seconds
    - Timeouts when fetching data
    - Intermittent slow responses

    **Cause:** Network latency, NPS API delays, or high server load

    **Solutions:**
    - Check your internet connection speed and stability
    - Verify NPS API status (check [status.nps.gov](https://www.nps.gov) for outages)
    - Reduce number of simultaneous requests
    - Use smaller `limit` values for initial queries (e.g., limit=5 instead of 50)
    - Try again in a few moments (may be temporary API congestion)
    - Implement local caching for frequently accessed data

    **Expected Response Times:**
    - Single park search: 1-2 seconds
    - Park details: 1-2 seconds
    - Alerts: &lt;1 second
    - Visitor centers: 1-2 seconds
    - Campgrounds: 1-2 seconds
    - Events: 1-2 seconds
    - Multiple park queries: 3-5 seconds
