## What are MCP Servers?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend your AI assistant with specialized tools and capabilities. Each server provides focused functionality - from accessing documentation and databases to processing documents and analyzing data.

**Benefits:**
- **Specialized Tools**: Each server provides domain-specific capabilities
- **Easy Integration**: Add servers to NimbleBrain Studio with one click
- **Natural Language**: Control everything through conversation
- **Composable**: Use multiple servers together for powerful workflows

<Info>
All MCP servers work seamlessly in NimbleBrain Studio. Configure once, then interact naturally through conversation.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    Begin with one or two servers that match your immediate needs. Get comfortable with how they work before adding more.

    **Recommended first servers:**
    - Ref (for documentation)
    - Tavily (for web search)
    - PostgreSQL (if you use databases)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Configure Once, Use Everywhere" icon="gear">
    Set up your API keys and credentials once in Studio settings. They'll work across all your playbooks automatically.

    **Tip:** Use environment variables for sensitive credentials.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Combine Servers" icon="puzzle-piece">
    The real power comes from using multiple servers together. Research with Tavily, reference docs with Ref, store data with PostgreSQL.

    **Think workflows, not individual tools.**
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-simple">
    Keep an eye on API usage for paid services. Most servers show usage in their dashboards.

    **Set up alerts** for approaching limits on critical services.
