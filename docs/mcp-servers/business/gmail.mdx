## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Google Account">
    NimbleBrain Studio uses OAuth2 to securely connect to your Gmail account.

    3. Search for "Gmail"
    4. Click **Install**
    5. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Google account

## Authentication

<Info>
  **OAuth2 Authentication**: This connection uses OAuth2 for secure authentication through Composio.
</Info>

### How It Works

When you connect Gmail in NimbleBrain Studio:

1. You'll be redirected to Google's authorization page
2. Log in with your Google account
3. Review and grant permissions
4. You're automatically redirected back to Studio

### Required Scopes

The integration requests the following Gmail scopes:

**Email Scopes:**
- `gmail.readonly` - Read email messages and settings
- `gmail.modify` - Read, send, delete, and manage labels
- `gmail.compose` - Create and send new emails
- `gmail.send` - Send email on your behalf

**Contact Scopes:**
- `contacts.readonly` - Read contacts
- `contacts.other.readonly` - Read "other contacts"

**Profile Scopes:**
- `userinfo.email` - View email address
- `userinfo.profile` - View basic profile info

<Tip>
  You can manage connected apps in your Google Account under **Security** → **Third-party apps with account access**.
</Tip>

## Rate Limits

Gmail API enforces quota limits:

| Limit Type | Restriction |
|------------|-------------|
| Daily sending | 500 emails/day (consumer), 2,000/day (Workspace) |
| Per-user rate | 250 quota units per user per second |
| Batch requests | 100 requests per batch |

**Quota Units by Operation:**
- `messages.list` - 5 units
- `messages.get` - 5 units
- `messages.send` - 100 units
- `drafts.create` - 10 units
- `labels.list` - 1 unit

<Info>
  Studio automatically handles rate limiting with exponential backoff for retries.
</Info>
