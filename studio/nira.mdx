## Example Conversations

<CodeGroup>

```plaintext Sales Report Automation
You: "Create a daily report that pulls sales data from Salesforce and sends it to our #sales-team Slack channel every morning at 9am"

Nira: "I'll create a playbook that:
1. Connects to Salesforce
2. Queries yesterday's closed deals and calculates total revenue
3. Formats the data as a summary report with top performers
4. Sends to Slack channel #sales-team at 9:00 AM daily

You'll need to provide:
- Salesforce API credentials (Consumer Key and Secret)
- Slack workspace token

Ready to add these credentials?"

You: "Yes, let's set it up"

Nira: "Great! First, let's add your Salesforce credentials..."
```

```plaintext Multi-Step Workflow
You: "I want to automate our customer onboarding. When a new customer signs up in Stripe, create a Zendesk ticket, send a welcome email, and add them to our HubSpot CRM."

Nira: "I'll build a multi-step automation that:

Step 1: Monitors Stripe for new subscriptions
Step 2: Creates a welcome ticket in Zendesk for our success team
Step 3: Sends personalized welcome email with getting started guide
Step 4: Adds customer to HubSpot with 'New Customer' tag

This requires:
- Stripe webhook configuration (I'll generate this)
- Zendesk API token
- SendGrid API key (for emails)
- HubSpot API key

The workflow will execute automatically whenever a new customer subscribes. Would you like me to proceed with this setup?"

You: "Perfect! Yes, let's build it"
```

```plaintext Weather-Based Alerts
You: "Monitor weather for our 5 warehouse locations. If any location expects severe weather in the next 24 hours, alert the logistics team"

Nira: "I'll create a weather monitoring automation:

1. Uses OpenWeatherMap to check forecasts for all 5 warehouse locations
2. Runs every 6 hours to stay current
3. Identifies severe weather alerts (storms, snow, hurricanes)
4. Sends immediate alerts to logistics team via email and Slack
5. Includes affected location, weather type, and timing

I'll need:
- Warehouse addresses or coordinates (you can provide these now or later)
- OpenWeatherMap API key
- Logistics team email addresses or Slack channel

Shall we configure these settings?"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Writing Effective Automation Requests

### Be Specific About Outcomes

<Check>**Good:** "Send me a daily summary of GitHub pull requests that need review, organized by priority, every morning at 9am"</Check>

**Vague:** "Do something with GitHub"

### Include Timing Requirements

<Check>**Good:** "Check for new invoices in Stripe every hour and sync them to QuickBooks immediately"</Check>

**Missing Info:** "Sync Stripe invoices to QuickBooks"

### Mention All Systems Involved

<Check>**Good:** "When a support ticket is marked urgent in Zendesk, create a task in Asana and notify the team lead via Slack"</Check>

**Incomplete:** "Do something when tickets are urgent"

### Specify Conditions and Filters

<Check>**Good:** "Monitor Twitter for mentions of our brand with negative sentiment and create Zendesk tickets for customer service follow-up"</Check>

**Too Broad:** "Monitor Twitter mentions"

<Tip>
  **Don't worry about being too detailed!** Nira will ask clarifying questions if it needs more information.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Then Iterate">
    Begin with a basic version of your automation and ask Nira to add complexity:

    1. "Create a daily sales report from Salesforce"
    2. Once working: "Add revenue trends compared to last week"
    3. Then: "Include top 3 performing sales reps"
    4. Finally: "Send to executives in PDF format"

    This iterative approach ensures each piece works before adding more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Business Language, Not Technical Terms">
    Nira understands business processes better than technical jargon:

    **Good:** "When a customer's trial ends, send them pricing information"

    **Unnecessarily Technical:** "Trigger webhook on trial_end event to execute email_send function with pricing payload"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Describe the 'Why' Along with the 'What'">
    Providing context helps Nira build better automations:

    **Better:** "We need to track inventory levels because we've had stockouts. Alert purchasing when items drop below 20 units so they can reorder in time."

    **Basic:** "Alert when inventory is below 20 units"

    The context helps Nira include relevant details in alerts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test with Real Data">
    After Nira builds your automation, test it:

    1. Run the playbook manually first
    2. Check that outputs match expectations
    3. Verify notifications go to the right places
    4. Ask Nira to adjust if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage Nira's Knowledge">
    Nira knows which integrations work well together. Ask for suggestions:

    - "What's the best way to automate customer onboarding?"
    - "How can I monitor our application performance?"
    - "What integrations are available for e-commerce?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Use Nira vs. Manual Playbooks

### Use Nira When:

<Check>You're new to automation or NimbleBrain Studio</Check>
<Check>You need to build something quickly</Check>
<Check>You're not sure which tools to use</Check>
<Check>Your automation involves multiple systems</Check>
<Check>You want to describe requirements in business terms</Check>
<Check>You're prototyping or experimenting with ideas</Check>

### Use Manual Playbooks When:

- You need very specific, custom instructions
- You're building a template for others to reuse
- You want fine-grained control over every parameter
- You're an experienced user who knows exactly what you need

<Note>
  You can always **start with Nira** and then **refine manually** if needed. Nira generates standard playbooks that you can edit.
</Note>

    Nira currently works best with English, but can understand other major languages. Responses are always in English.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Nira access my data?">
    Your API keys and secrets are encrypted and never visible to Nira. When Nira executes tools on your behalf, the results are processed to generate responses but are not permanently stored or logged. Nira has access to:

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if Nira doesn't understand my request?">
    Nira will ask clarifying questions to better understand your needs. If she still can't help, she will suggest breaking down the request or provide guidance on how to rephrase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit playbooks that Nira creates?">
    Yes! Nira generates standard playbooks that you can view, edit, and customize just like manually-created ones.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does using Nira cost extra?">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Suggestions

Nira learns from your workspace:
- Suggests integrations you've used before
- Remembers your notification preferences
- Adapts to your organization's naming conventions
- Understands your scheduling patterns

### Workflow Optimization

Nira can optimize existing playbooks:

**Say:** "Make my sales report playbook faster"

Nira will analyze the playbook and suggest optimizations like:
- Parallel tool execution
- Reduced API calls
- Caching strategies
- Simplified logic

### Multi-Step Workflows

For complex automations that need multiple data sources or sequential steps, Nira creates sophisticated playbooks:

<Card>
**Example:**

**You:** "I need to pull sales data from Salesforce, get market trends from Finnhub, analyze both with AI, and send a report to Slack every Monday morning"

**Nira:** "I'll create a playbook that:

1. Fetches weekly sales data from Salesforce
2. Pulls relevant market trends from Finnhub
3. Analyzes combined data and generates insights
4. Formats and sends report to your Slack channel

This will run every Monday at 9 AM. Would you like me to set that up?"
</Card>

Nira handles the complexity of:
- Coordinating multiple data sources
- Sequencing operations correctly
- Managing data flow between steps
- Configuring the schedule

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **Current Limitations:**
  - Nira cannot access integrations that aren't in the NimbleBrain registry
  - Very complex custom logic may require manual refinement
  - Nira cannot directly modify running playbooks (you must redeploy)
  - Conversation context is limited to the current session
</Warning>

## Tips for Success

1. **Be conversational** - Talk to Nira like you would a colleague
2. **Provide examples** - Show Nira what output you want
3. **Ask questions** - Nira can explain how things work
4. **Iterate** - Refine automations through conversation
5. **Test early** - Deploy simple versions first, then enhance
6. **Give feedback** - Tell Nira if results aren't what you expected
