</Tip>

## Step 1: NIRA's Introduction

When you first log into NimbleBrain Studio at [studio.nimblebrain.ai](https://studio.nimblebrain.ai?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=studio), you'll see NIRA's welcome message:

<Card>
**NIRA says:** 👋

"Hi! I'm NIRA, your automation assistant. I'm here to help you build powerful automations through simple conversation.

Let's create your first automation together! I'll guide you through every step.

Ready to get started?"
</Card>

Click **"Yes, let's build something!"** to begin.

<Note>
Don't worry about making mistakes—NIRA is patient and will help you every step of the way!
</Note>

## Step 2: Describe Your Automation

NIRA will ask you what you'd like to automate. For this tutorial, try one of these examples:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example 1: Weather Alert (Easiest)">
    **Say to NIRA:**

    "Send me a Slack message every morning at 8am with today's weather forecast for San Francisco"

    **What NIRA does:**
    - Uses OpenWeatherMap for weather data
    - Connects to Slack for messaging
    - Creates a daily 8am schedule
    - Asks for your OpenWeatherMap API key and Slack credentials
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example 2: Daily Calendar Summary">
    **Say to NIRA:**

    "Create a daily summary of my Google Calendar events and email it to me at 6am"

    **What NIRA does:**
    - Connects to Google Calendar
    - Formats your day's events
    - Sends email via your preferred email service
    - Asks for Google Calendar and email credentials
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example 3: Price Monitor">
    **Say to NIRA:**

    "Check Bitcoin price every hour and notify me on Slack if it goes above $100,000"

    **What NIRA does:**
    - Sets up cryptocurrency price tracking
    - Implements conditional logic (only alert if > $100k)
    - Schedules hourly checks
    - Asks for Slack credentials
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/studio/nira-conversation.png" alt="Chatting with NIRA" />
</Frame>

### What NIRA Does Behind the Scenes

When you describe your automation, NIRA:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understands Intent">
    Parses your natural language request to understand what you want
  </Step>
  <Step title="Selects Tools">
    Identifies which integrations are needed (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Slack)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Designs Workflow">
    Determines the automation schedule, logic, and data flow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generates Playbook">
    Creates a complete playbook configuration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identifies Credentials">
    Figures out which API keys you'll need to provide
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Be specific!** Include timing ("every morning at 8am"), data sources ("my Google Calendar"), and outputs ("send to my email").
</Tip>

## Step 3: Add Your API Keys

NIRA will identify which services you need and prompt for credentials:

<Card>
**NIRA says:** 🔑

"Great! To build this automation, I need access to:

- **OpenWeatherMap API** (for weather data)
- **Slack** (to send you messages)

Let's add these credentials to your workspace. I'll walk you through each one.

Don't have an OpenWeatherMap account? No problem! I'll show you how to get a free API key—it only takes a minute."
</Card>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add API Key'">
    NIRA will show a secure form for each service
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow NIRA's Guidance">
    NIRA provides direct links to get API keys from each service:
    - Click the link NIRA provides
    - Sign up or log in to the service
    - Generate your API key
    - Copy it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste Credentials">
    Return to Studio and paste the API key into the secure form
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Securely">
    NIRA encrypts and stores your keys in your workspace
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Security Note**: Your API keys are encrypted and never shared. They're stored securely in your workspace and only accessible to your automations. NIRA never sees or logs your credentials.
</Warning>

<Callout type="info">
**Taking too long?** No worries! NIRA saves your progress. You can come back later to finish adding credentials.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Review Your Playbook

Once you've added credentials, NIRA shows you the generated playbook before deploying:

<Card>
**NIRA says:** 📋

"Here's what I've built for you:

**Automation Name:** Morning Weather Alert
**Schedule:** Daily at 8:00 AM Pacific Time
**Tools Used:** OpenWeatherMap, Slack

**What it does:**
1. Fetches current weather and 24-hour forecast for San Francisco
2. Formats a friendly message with temperature, conditions, and forecast
3. Sends to your Slack DM

Everything look good? You can deploy it now or ask me to make changes!"
</Card>

You can:
- ✅ **Deploy Now** - Launch your automation immediately
- ✏️ **Edit** - Ask NIRA to modify anything ("Change it to 7am" or "Add wind speed")
- 👀 **View Details** - See the full playbook configuration
- 🗑️ **Start Over** - Have NIRA build something different

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/studio/playbooks-example.png" alt="Reviewing playbook with NIRA" />
</Frame>

## Step 5: Deploy & Test

Click **"Deploy Automation"** and NIRA handles the rest:

<Steps>
  <Step title="NIRA Validates Configuration">
    Checks that all tools are properly connected and credentials work
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Run">
    NIRA runs a test to ensure everything works correctly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule Activation">
    Your automation goes live on the schedule you specified
  </Step>
  <Step title="Immediate Confirmation">
    You'll see the first result immediately—NIRA sends a test message!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/studio/nira-deployed.png" alt="Automation Deployed" />
</Frame>

<Callout type="success">
**Congratulations!** 🎉 You've built your first automation with NIRA. Check your Slack for the test message!
</Callout>

## Step 6: Monitor & Manage

After deployment, NIRA shows you how to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

## Tips for Working with NIRA

Make the most of your NIRA experience with these tips:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific About Timing">
    **Good:** "Every Monday at 9am"
    **Better:** "Every weekday at 9am except holidays"
    **Best:** "Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 9am Pacific Time"

    NIRA understands natural language timing but specificity helps ensure you get exactly what you want.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Name Your Data Sources">
    **Vague:** "Get sales data"
    **Better:** "Get sales data from Stripe"
    **Best:** "Get yesterday's sales data from our Stripe account and calculate total revenue"

    The more specific you are about WHERE data comes from, the better NIRA can build your automation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Describe the Output Format">
    **Basic:** "Send me a report"
    **Better:** "Email me a report"
    **Best:** "Email me a PDF report with charts showing revenue trends"

    Tell NIRA HOW and WHERE you want results delivered.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ask for Modifications Anytime">
    You can always refine automations:
    - "Make the report more detailed"
    - "Change the schedule to 6am"
    - "Add weather data to the summary"
    - "Only send alerts if revenue is above $10k"

    NIRA treats modifications like a conversation—just ask!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Examples">
    Show NIRA what you want:
    - "Format it like: 'Today's weather: 72°F, Sunny. Forecast: Clear skies.'"
    - "Include metrics similar to last week's report"

    Examples help NIRA understand your preferences.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit NIRA's automations manually?">
    Yes! Every automation NIRA creates is a standard playbook you can view and edit. Click on any playbook to see its configuration, instructions, and settings.

    You can switch between NIRA mode and manual mode anytime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if NIRA doesn't understand my request?">
    NIRA will ask clarifying questions:
    - "Could you be more specific about the timing?"
    - "Which email address should I send to?"
    - "What should trigger this automation?"

    Answer her questions and she'll figure it out!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know what tools/services NIRA can use?">
    Browse [Connections](/studio/connections) to see all 50+ integrations. NIRA automatically knows about all of them and will select the best ones for your needs.

    If NIRA doesn't have an integration for something, she'll let you know and may suggest alternatives.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can NIRA build really complex automations?">
    Absolutely! NIRA can handle:
    - Multi-step workflows with conditional logic
    - Automations that use 5+ different tools
    - Scheduled tasks with complex timing rules
    - Data transformations and calculations

    Start simple and ask NIRA to add complexity as you go.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my automation fails?">
    NIRA monitors all automations and will:
    1. Notify you if something fails
    2. Show you detailed error logs
    3. Help you fix the issue

    Just tell NIRA "My weather automation isn't working" and she'll investigate.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="NIRA says she needs more information">
    **Issue:** Your request was too vague.

    **Solution:** Be more specific about:
    - Timing ("when should this run?")
    - Data sources ("which service has the data?")
    - Output destination ("where should results go?")

    **Example:**
    Instead of: "Send me updates"
    Try: "Send me Slack alerts every hour with Bitcoin price from CoinGecko"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API key connection failed">
    **Issue:** The credentials you entered aren't working.

    **Solution:**
    - Double-check you copied the entire key (no extra spaces)
    - Verify the key hasn't expired
    - Make sure the account has proper permissions
    - Try regenerating the key and adding it again

    NIRA will guide you through re-adding credentials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automation didn't run on schedule">
    **Issue:** Your automation missed its scheduled time.

    **Solution:**
    - Check the execution logs in the Monitoring tab
    - NIRA may have encountered an issue with an external service
    - Click "Run Now" to test manually
    - Ask NIRA: "Why didn't my weather alert run this morning?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Results aren't formatted how I want">
    **Issue:** The output format doesn't match your expectations.

    **Solution:** Tell NIRA exactly how you want it formatted:
    - "Make the report shorter and only include the top 3 items"
    - "Add emojis to make it more visual"
    - "Format dates as MM/DD/YYYY instead of YYYY-MM-DD"

    NIRA will update the automation instantly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="NIRA is taking a long time to respond">
    **Issue:** NIRA seems slow or unresponsive.

    **Solution:**
    - Check your internet connection
    - Refresh the page
    - If the issue persists, the platform may be experiencing high load—try again in a few minutes

    Your conversation is saved, so you won't lose progress.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Ready to build something more complex? Open NIRA and start a new conversation!

<Callout type="success">
**Pro tip:** The more you use NIRA, the better she understands your preferences and style. Build a few automations and watch how quickly you can go from idea to deployed solution.
</Callout>

<Tip>
**Ready for more complexity?** Once you're comfortable with single playbooks, try building an [Agent](/studio/agents) that coordinates multiple automations together. Agents are perfect for multi-step workflows like "morning routine" or "weekly reporting."
