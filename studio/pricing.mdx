## Credits

Credits are the currency that powers your AI automations in NimbleBrain Studio.

### How Credits Work

Every time you run a playbook or interact with Nira, credits are consumed based on the complexity of the task:

| Task Type | Typical Credit Usage |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Simple questions | 1-2 credits |
| Basic automations | 2-5 credits |
| Complex workflows | 5-10+ credits |

<Tip>
  Credits are consumed based on AI model usage (tokens processed). Simple tasks use fewer credits, while complex multi-step automations use more.
</Tip>

### Credit Allocation

- **Free plan**: 50 credits/month + 250 bonus credits on signup
- **Starter plan**: 1,000 credits/month
- **Business plan**: 10,000 credits/month
- **Enterprise**: Custom allocation

### Overage

If you exceed your monthly credits:

| Plan | Overage Policy |
|------|----------------|
| Free | Wait until next month (no overage available) |
| Starter | $0.06 per additional credit |
| Business | $0.025 per additional credit |

## Connections

Connections are integrations that give your playbooks access to external services like Gmail, Slack, GitHub, and more.

### Free Connections

</CardGroup>

Free connections have **no install limits**. You can install all 4 on any plan.

### Premium Connections

All other connections are premium and require a paid subscription. Your plan determines how many premium connections you can have installed at once:

| Plan | Premium Connection Limit |
|------|--------------------------|
| Free | 0 (free connections only) |
| Starter | 5 installed at once |
| Business | 10 installed at once |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

<Warning>
  **Important:** Premium connection limits apply **across all workspaces** in your account. For example, if you're on Starter and have 3 premium connections in Workspace A and 2 in Workspace B, you've reached your limit of 5.
</Warning>

### Swapping Connections

You can uninstall premium connections and install different ones at any time. The limit only applies to how many are installed simultaneously, not the total number you can ever use.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Uninstall">
    Remove a premium connection you no longer need
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install">
    Install a different premium connection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Set up API keys for the new connection
  </Step>
</Steps>
