## Authentication

<Info>
  **API Key Authentication**: This connection uses API key authentication.
</Info>

### How It Works

Perplexity authenticates requests using your API key:

1. You provide your API key during connection setup
2. NimbleBrain stores it securely and encrypted
3. Each request includes your key in the authorization header
4. Perplexity validates the key and processes the request

### API Key Security

**Best Practices:**
- Never share your API key publicly
- Rotate keys periodically for security
- Monitor usage in Perplexity dashboard
- Use different keys for different projects
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

<Tip>
  You can manage your API keys and monitor usage at [perplexity.ai/settings/api](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api)
</Tip>

### Getting Your API Key

1. Visit [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai)
2. Sign in to your account (or create one)
3. Navigate to **Settings → API**
4. Click **Generate New API Key**
5. Copy your API key
6. Add it to Studio during connection setup

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure. It provides access to your Perplexity account and quota. Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

Perplexity enforces usage limits based on your plan:

**Quota Tracking:**
- Each search query consumes API credits
- Limits vary by subscription tier
- Monitor usage in Perplexity dashboard
- Costs depend on your pricing plan

<Info>
  Studio automatically handles rate limiting and will queue requests if limits are reached. Check your Perplexity dashboard for detailed usage information.
</Info>

### Query Optimization

To maximize your quota:
- Use specific, well-crafted queries
- Combine related questions when possible
- Cache frequently accessed information
- Avoid redundant searches
- Monitor usage patterns
