### Search Tools

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Web Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Perform semantic searches to find relevant web content.

    | `EXA_SEARCH` | Search the web using AI-powered semantic understanding. Returns URLs, titles, and metadata. |

    **Parameters:**
    - `query` - Your search query (natural language)
    - `numResults` - Number of results to return (default: 10, max: 100)
    - `type` - Search type: `neural` (semantic) or `keyword` (traditional)

## Authentication

<Info>
  **API Key Authentication**: This connection uses API key authentication.
</Info>

### How It Works

When you connect Exa in NimbleBrain Studio:

1. You'll be prompted to enter your Exa API key
2. The key is encrypted and stored securely in your workspace
3. All API requests include the key in the authorization header
4. You can rotate or update your key anytime in connection settings

### Security Best Practices

**Protecting Your API Key:**
- Never share your API key publicly
- Don't commit API keys to version control
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use separate keys for different environments
- Revoke unused keys in your Exa dashboard

<Tip>
  You can manage your API keys in the Exa dashboard under Settings. Create separate keys for different applications to improve security and tracking.
</Tip>

## Rate Limits

Exa enforces rate limits based on your plan:

| Plan | Monthly Searches | Rate Limit |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Free | 1,000 searches | 10 requests/minute |
| Basic | 10,000 searches | 60 requests/minute |
| Pro | 100,000 searches | 300 requests/minute |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

**Usage Tips:**
- Monitor your usage in the Exa dashboard
- Batch requests when possible
- Cache frequently accessed content
- Use appropriate `numResults` limits
- Consider upgrading for higher volume needs

<Info>
  Studio automatically handles rate limiting and will retry requests with exponential backoff if limits are reached.
</Info>
