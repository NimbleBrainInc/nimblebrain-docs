## Authentication

<Info>
  **API Key Authentication**: This connection uses API key authentication.
</Info>

### How It Works

SerpApi authenticates requests using your API key:

1. You provide your API key during connection setup
2. NimbleBrain stores it securely and encrypted
3. Each request includes your key in the query parameters
4. SerpApi validates the key and processes the request

### API Key Security

**Best Practices:**
- Never share your API key publicly
- Rotate keys periodically
- Monitor usage in SerpApi dashboard
- Use different keys for different projects
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

<Tip>
  You can manage your API keys and monitor usage at [serpapi.com/account](https://serpapi.com/account)
</Tip>

## Rate Limits

SerpApi enforces usage limits based on your plan:

| Plan | Monthly Searches | Rate Limit |
|------|------------------|------------|
| Free | 100 searches | 5 searches/second |
| Developer | 5,000 searches | 10 searches/second |
| Production | 30,000 searches | 20 searches/second |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

**Quota Tracking:**
- Each search consumes 1 credit
- Pagination counts as separate searches
- Credits reset monthly
- Overage charges apply on paid plans

<Info>
  Studio automatically handles rate limiting and will queue requests if limits are reached.
</Info>

### Search Optimization

To maximize your quota:
- Use specific queries to reduce result pagination
- Cache frequently accessed results
- Combine multiple data points in single searches
- Use time filters to narrow results
- Batch similar searches together

## Troubleshooting
