## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Exceeded" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Error Message:**

```
429 Too Many Requests - API rate limit exceeded
```

    **Cause:** You've exceeded 60 requests/minute (free tier)

    **Solutions:**
    - Wait 1 minute before making more requests
    - Upgrade to a paid Finnhub plan (300 or 600 requests/minute)
    - Reduce the number of stocks you're tracking simultaneously
    - Space out your requests over time in Studio conversations

    **To check your usage:**
    1. Go to Studio Connections
    2. Click on Finnhub
    3. View API usage metrics

    <Tip>
      Studio shows real-time API usage. Consider upgrading your Finnhub plan if you frequently hit limits during market hours.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid API Key" icon="key">
    **Error Message:**

```
401 Unauthorized - Invalid API key
```

    **Cause:** API key is missing, incorrect, or expired

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify your API key in Studio server settings
    - Check for extra spaces or characters when you pasted it
    - Regenerate your API key from the Finnhub dashboard
    - Ensure your Finnhub account is active and email verified

    **To update in Studio:**
    1. Connections → Finnhub
    2. Click **Edit Configuration**
    3. Paste your new API key in FINNHUB_API_KEY field
    4. Click **Save**
    5. Test with a simple query like "What's AAPL stock price?"

    <Info>
      Studio validates your API key automatically when you save. You'll see a success message if it's correct.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Symbol Not Found" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Error Message:**

```
Symbol not found or invalid
```

    **Cause:** Invalid ticker symbol or the stock is not available in Finnhub's database

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify the ticker symbol is correct (e.g., AAPL not APPLE)
    - Use the company name instead: "What's Apple's stock price?" (Studio will find the symbol)
    - Check if the symbol is listed on a supported exchange
    - Try alternative ticker formats (e.g., BRK.B for Berkshire Hathaway Class B)

    **Common Mistakes:**
    - Using company name as symbol: "APPLE" instead of "AAPL"
    - Wrong exchange suffix: "AAPL.US" instead of "AAPL"
    - Delisted or merged companies
    - International stocks not in free tier

    <Tip>
      Let Studio's AI help! Ask: "What's the ticker symbol for Tesla?" before requesting detailed data.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Server Not Responding" icon="server">
    **Error Message:**

```
Server connection timeout or Server not responding
```

    **Cause:** Studio cannot connect to the Finnhub integration

    **Solutions:**
    - Check your internet connection
    - Verify the server is enabled in Studio (Connections)
    - Try disabling and re-enabling the server in Studio
    - Check Studio status page for any service interruptions
    - Refresh your Studio browser tab

    **Quick Fix in Studio:**
    1. Go to Connections
    2. Find Finnhub in the list
    3. Toggle it Off, wait 5 seconds
    4. Toggle it On again
    5. Try your query again

    <Info>
      Studio manages all server infrastructure automatically - there's no local setup or Docker containers to troubleshoot.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Unavailable" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Error Message:**

```
Data not available for this symbol/timeframe

    **Free tier limitations:**
    - US stocks only (NYSE, NASDAQ)

    - Upgrade to a paid Finnhub plan for extended data access

    **To upgrade:**
    1. Visit [finnhub.io/pricing](https://finnhub.io/pricing)
    2. Choose a plan (Starter or Professional)
    3. Update your API key in Studio if it changes
