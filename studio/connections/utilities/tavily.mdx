    3. Test with known queries that should have results
    4. Verify internet connectivity

    <Tip>
      Start with broad queries to establish that content exists, then use follow-up queries to narrow focus based on initial results.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow Response Time" icon="clock">
    **Issue:** Searches taking longer than expected

    **Solutions:**
    - Check your internet connection speed
    - Verify Tavily API status at [status.tavily.com](https://status.tavily.com) (if available)
    - Reduce search depth to "basic" for faster results
    - Decrease max_results parameter (e.g., 5 instead of 20)
    - Simplify complex multi-part queries
    - Break compound questions into separate queries
    - Consider query complexity (more filters = more processing)
    - Check for Tavily service announcements

    **Typical response times:**
    - Basic search: 2-3 seconds
    - Advanced search: 4-6 seconds
    - Extract (single URL): 1-2 seconds
    - Extract (multiple URLs): 2-4 seconds
    - Crawl (depth 1, 10 pages): 3-5 seconds
    - Crawl (depth 2, 50 pages): 8-12 seconds
    - Map (50 URLs): 2-4 seconds

    **Performance tips:**
    - Use basic search for quick lookups
    - Advanced search for comprehensive research only
    - Limit crawl depth and breadth for faster results
    - Map sites before crawling to understand scope

    <Note>
      Advanced searches and deep crawls are more thorough but take longer. Balance speed vs. comprehensiveness based on your needs.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Poor Result Quality" icon="thumbs-down">
    **Issue:** Results are not relevant or low quality

    **Solutions:**
    - Use more specific, detailed search queries
    - Add domain filters for trusted, authoritative sources
    - Exclude known low-quality or unreliable domains
    - Increase search depth from "basic" to "advanced"
    - Provide more context in your query
    - Use quotes for exact phrase matching
    - Filter by date for recent, current content
    - Specify topic="news" for current events

    **Query improvement examples:**

    **Basic:** "AI news"
    - Too broad, mixed quality results

    **Better:** "Latest AI breakthroughs in healthcare 2024"
    - More specific topic, time frame, industry

    **Best:** "Recent FDA-approved AI medical diagnostic tools and clinical trial results"
    - Very specific, implies authoritative sources

    **Domain filtering for quality:**
    - Academic: `["arxiv.org", "scholar.google.com", "pubmed.gov"]`
    - Business: `["bloomberg.com", "reuters.com", "wsj.com"]`
    - Tech: `["arstechnica.com", "techcrunch.com", "theverge.com"]`

    <Tip>
      More specific queries with context and constraints produce higher quality, more relevant results. Invest time in query crafting.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Domain Filtering Not Working" icon="filter">
    **Issue:** Domain filters not producing expected results

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify domain format: use "example.com" not "https://example.com"
    - Check for typos in domain names
    - Ensure domains actually have content matching your query
    - Don't over-filter (too many restrictions = no results)
    - Use include OR exclude, not both for same domains
    - Test without filters first to verify content exists
    - Check that domain is spelled exactly as it appears in URLs

    **Correct domain format examples:**

    ✅ Correct:
    ```json
    ["nytimes.com", "washingtonpost.com", "reuters.com"]
    ```

    ❌ Incorrect:
    ```json
    ["https://nytimes.com", "www.washingtonpost.com", "https://www.reuters.com/"]
    ```

    **Testing approach:**
    1. Search without domain filters first
    2. Verify which domains appear in results
    3. Use exact domain names from those results
    4. Add filters one at a time

    <Warning>
      Overly restrictive domain filters can result in zero results even for valid queries. Start with 2-3 trusted domains, not 20.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Crawl/Map Incomplete Results" icon="spider">
    **Issue:** Crawler or mapper returning fewer pages than expected

    **Solutions:**
    - Check site's robots.txt (some sites block crawlers)
    - Increase limit parameter (default is 50)
    - Increase max_depth to explore deeper
    - Increase max_breadth to follow more links per page
    - Remove overly restrictive select_paths patterns
    - Verify select_domains regex is correct
    - Check if site requires authentication (crawler can't access)
    - Some sites may have JavaScript-only navigation (not crawlable)

    **Understanding limits:**
    - `limit`: Total pages to process before stopping
    - `max_depth`: How many levels deep from base URL
    - `max_breadth`: How many links per page

    **Example:**
    - depth=2, breadth=10, limit=50
    - Level 0: 1 page (base URL)
    - Level 1: up to 10 pages (first 10 links from base)
    - Level 2: up to 100 pages (10 links from each L1 page)
    - But limited to 50 total pages by `limit` parameter

    **Optimization:**
    - Map first to understand actual site structure
    - Use path patterns to focus on relevant sections
    - Adjust depth/breadth based on map results
    - Increase limit gradually to avoid over-crawling

    <Tip>
      Always map a site first to understand its structure and size before crawling. This helps you set appropriate limits.
    </Tip>

      Studio manages all server infrastructure automatically - no local setup or maintenance required.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools Not Triggering" icon="tools">
    **Issue:** Studio doesn't use Tavily tools when expected

    **Solutions:**
    - Be more explicit: mention "search the web" or "use Tavily"
    - Verify server shows "Active" status in Studio
    - Check API key is correctly configured
    - Provide clear action verbs: "search", "find", "extract", "crawl"
    - Include specific URLs when you want extraction
    - Don't ask Studio to find URLs - provide them directly
    - Use phrases that indicate web search intent

    **Example effective prompts:**

    ✅ Good - Clear web search intent:
    - "Search the web for recent AI developments"
    - "Find the latest news about climate policy"
    - "Search for expert opinions on remote work"

    ✅ Good - Explicit extraction:
    - "Extract content from this URL: [url]"

  <Accordion title="Crawling & Mapping Strategies" icon="spider">
    **Effective Website Analysis:**

    **When to Use Map vs. Crawl:**

    **Use Map when:**
    - Understanding site structure first
    - You need a site overview
    - Planning a targeted crawl
    - Checking link validity
    - Auditing site architecture
    - You don't need page content yet

    **Use Crawl when:**
    - You need actual page content
    - Building a knowledge base
    - Extracting documentation
    - Collecting data at scale
    - Deep content analysis required
    - Following up after mapping

    **Parameter Strategy:**

    **max_depth:**
    - 1: Current page + direct links (homepage + main sections)
    - 2: Two levels deep (homepage → section → subsection)
    - 3+: Deep exploration (use cautiously with large sites)

    **max_breadth:**
    - 10: Focused exploration, main links only
    - 20: Balanced coverage (default)
    - 50+: Comprehensive but slower

    **limit:**
    - 20: Quick sampling
    - 50: Medium site coverage (default)
    - 100: Large site exploration
    - 200+: Comprehensive archival

    **Path Patterns:**
    ```javascript
    ["/docs/.*"]           // Only documentation pages
    ["/api/v2/.*"]        // Specific API version
    ["/blog/\\d{4}/.*"]   // Blog posts with year
    ["/products/.*"]       // Product pages
    ```

    **Domain Patterns:**
    ```javascript
    ["^docs\\.example\\.com$"]           // Exact subdomain
    ["^.*\\.example\\.com$"]             // All subdomains
    ["^(docs|api)\\.example\\.com$"]     // Specific subdomains
    ```

    **Best Practices:**
    1. Always map large sites first
    2. Use path patterns to focus on relevant sections
    3. Start with conservative limits
    4. Increase depth/breadth based on map results
    5. Use instructions for semantic filtering
    6. Respect site's robots.txt and crawling policies

    <Warning>
      Large sites with high depth/breadth can consume many pages quickly. Start conservatively and adjust based on results.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Usage & Costs" icon="coins">
    **Understanding Request Consumption:**

    **Request Counting:**
    - **Search**: 1 request per query (regardless of max_results)
    - **Extract**: 1 request per call (multiple URLs = still 1 request)
    - **Crawl**: 1 request per session (all pages crawled = 1 request)
    - **Map**: 1 request per session (all URLs mapped = 1 request)

    **Cost-Effective Strategies:**

    **1. Batch Operations:**
    ```text
    ✅ Extract multiple URLs in one call:
    "Extract content from these 5 URLs: [url1, url2, url3, url4, url5]"
    → 1 request

    ❌ Extract URLs separately:
    5 separate extract calls
    → 5 requests
    ```

    **2. Strategic Search Depth:**
    - Use basic search (faster, same request count)
    - Reserve advanced for critical research only
    - Both consume 1 request, but advanced may take longer

    **3. Efficient Crawling:**
    ```text
    ✅ Map first, then targeted crawl:
    Map (1 request) → understand structure → focused crawl (1 request)
    → 2 requests total, but more efficient

    ❌ Blind crawling:
    Large crawl with poor parameters → wasted pages
    → 1 request, but inefficient use
    ```

    **4. Query Optimization:**
    - Craft specific queries to get right results first time
    - Poor query → no results → retry → multiple requests
    - Good query → useful results → one request

    **5. Result Caching:**
    - Enable caching in Studio for repeated queries
    - Cache research results in your workflow
    - Avoid re-searching the same topics

    **6. Time-Based Planning:**
    - Batch research tasks monthly if possible
    - Schedule regular monitoring (weekly, not daily)
    - Consolidate similar queries into comprehensive searches

    **Monthly Planning (1,000 requests):**
    - Daily research: ~33 requests/day
    - Weekly monitoring: ~250 requests/week
    - Mix of search (80%), extract (15%), crawl (5%)
