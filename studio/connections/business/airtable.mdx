## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Airtable Account">
    NimbleBrain Studio uses OAuth2 to securely connect to your Airtable account.

    1. Navigate to **Connections** in the sidebar
    2. Click **Browse Catalog**
    3. Search for "Airtable"
    4. Click **Install**
    5. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Airtable account
    6. Grant the requested permissions for Airtable access

    <Tip>
      OAuth2 provides secure, token-based authentication. You'll need to authorize access to your Airtable bases.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    Once connected, test the integration:

    ```text
    "List all my Airtable bases"
    ```

    **Other test prompts:**
    - "Show me the tables in my Marketing base"
    - "Get the first 10 records from my Contacts table"
    - "What fields are in my Projects table?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available Tools

## Authentication

<Info>
  **OAuth2 Authentication**: This connection uses OAuth2 for secure authentication.
</Info>

### How It Works

When you connect Airtable in NimbleBrain Studio:

1. You'll be redirected to Airtable's authorization page
2. Log in with your Airtable account
3. Review and grant permissions
4. You're automatically redirected back to Studio

### Required Scopes

The integration requests the following Airtable scopes:

**Data Scopes:**
- `data.records:read` - Read records from bases
- `data.records:write` - Create, update, and delete records
- `schema.bases:read` - Read base and table schemas
- `schema.bases:write` - Create and modify tables and fields

**Workspace Scopes:**
- `workspace.bases:read` - List all accessible bases
- `workspace.bases:write` - Create new bases (optional)

<Tip>
  You can manage connected apps in your Airtable account under **Account** → **Connected apps**.
</Tip>

## Rate Limits

Airtable API enforces rate limits:

| Limit Type | Restriction |
|------------|-------------|
| Requests per second | 5 requests/second per base |
| Records per request | 10 records max (create/update) |
| Records in response | 100 records max per page |
| Field limit | 500 fields per table |
| Attachment size | 20MB per file |

**Best Practices:**
- Use batch operations to minimize request count
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Cache schema information when possible
- Respect rate limits to avoid throttling

<Info>
  Studio automatically handles rate limiting with exponential backoff for retries.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Failed" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Issue:** OAuth authorization didn't complete
