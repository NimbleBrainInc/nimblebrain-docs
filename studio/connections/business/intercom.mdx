## Authentication

<Info>
  **OAuth2 Authentication**: This connection uses OAuth2 for secure authentication.
</Info>

### How It Works

When you connect Intercom in NimbleBrain Studio:

1. You'll be redirected to Intercom's authorization page
2. Log in with your Intercom account
3. Review and grant permissions
4. You're automatically redirected back to Studio

### Required Permissions

The integration requests the following Intercom permissions:

**Conversation Permissions:**
- Read conversations
- Write and reply to conversations
- Manage conversation assignments

**Contact & Company Permissions:**
- Read contact and company data
- Create and update contacts and companies
- Manage tags and attributes

**Content Permissions:**
- Read articles and knowledge base content
- Create and update articles
- Publish help center content

**Messaging Permissions:**
- Send messages to contacts
- Create and send email campaigns

<Tip>
  You can manage connected apps in Intercom under **Settings** → **Developers** → **Apps**.
</Tip>

### Access Levels

Different Intercom plans provide different API access:

| Plan | API Access |
|------|-----------|
| Starter | Basic API access with rate limits |
| Pro | Full API access |
| Premium | Full API access with higher limits |

<Note>
  Some advanced features may require specific Intercom plan levels. Check your plan details if you encounter permission issues.
</Note>

## Rate Limits

Intercom enforces rate limits based on your plan:

| Plan | Rate Limit |
|------|-----------|
| Starter | 500 requests per minute |
| Pro | 1,000 requests per minute |
| Premium | 2,000 requests per minute |

**Rate Limit Headers:**
- `X-RateLimit-Limit` - Total requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - Requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` - Time when limit resets

<Info>
  Studio automatically handles rate limiting with exponential backoff for retries.
