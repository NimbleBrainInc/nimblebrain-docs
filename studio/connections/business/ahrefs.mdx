    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Exceeded" icon="gauge">
    **Issue:** Too many requests or quota exceeded

    - Try different filters or broader search criteria

  <Accordion title="Slow Response Times" icon="clock">
    **Issue:** Queries taking longer than expected

    **Solutions:**
    - Large domain analyses can take 10-30 seconds
