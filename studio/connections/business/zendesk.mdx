## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Zendesk Account">
    NimbleBrain Studio uses OAuth2 to securely connect to your Zendesk account.

    1. Navigate to **Connections** in the sidebar
    2. Click **Browse Catalog**
    3. Search for "Zendesk"
    4. Click **Install**
    5. Click **Connect** and authorize with your Zendesk account
    6. Grant the requested permissions for Zendesk access

    <Tip>
      OAuth2 provides secure, token-based authentication. You'll need admin or agent permissions to authorize the integration.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    Once connected, test the integration:

    ```text
    "Show me all open tickets assigned to me"
    ```

    **Other test prompts:**

    - "Show me high-priority tickets"

## Authentication

<Info>
  **OAuth2 Authentication**: This connection uses OAuth2 for secure authentication.
</Info>

### How It Works

When you connect Zendesk in NimbleBrain Studio:

1. You'll be redirected to Zendesk's authorization page
2. Log in with your Zendesk account
3. Review and grant permissions
4. You're automatically redirected back to Studio

### Required Permissions

The integration requests the following Zendesk permissions:

**Read Access:**
- View tickets and comments
- Read user and organization information
- Access macros and automation rules
- View ticket fields and custom fields

**Write Access:**
- Create and update tickets
- Add comments and notes
- Manage users and organizations
- Apply macros and workflows
- Update ticket status and assignments

<Tip>
  You can manage connected apps in your Zendesk Admin Center under **Apps and integrations** → **APIs** → **Zendesk API**.
</Tip>

### Subdomain Configuration

During setup, you'll need to specify your Zendesk subdomain (e.g., `yourcompany.zendesk.com`). Make sure to enter only the subdomain portion without the full URL.

## Rate Limits

Zendesk API enforces rate limits based on your plan:

| Plan Type | Rate Limit |
|-----------|------------|
| Essential | 200 requests/minute |
| Team | 400 requests/minute |
| Professional | 700 requests/minute |
| Enterprise | 2,500 requests/minute |

**Additional Limits:**
- Search API: 20 requests/minute
- Incremental exports: 10 requests/minute
- Concurrent requests: 5 per account

<Info>
  Studio automatically handles rate limiting with exponential backoff for retries.
</Info>
