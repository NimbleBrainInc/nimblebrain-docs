## Authentication

<Info>
  **OAuth2 Authentication**: This connection uses OAuth2 for secure authentication.
</Info>

### How It Works

When you connect HubSpot in NimbleBrain Studio:

1. You'll be redirected to HubSpot's authorization page
2. Log in with your HubSpot account
3. Grant the requested permissions
4. You're automatically redirected back to Studio

### Required Scopes

The integration requests appropriate scopes based on your needs:

**CRM Scopes:**
- `crm.objects.contacts.read` / `.write` - Contact management
- `crm.objects.companies.read` / `.write` - Company management
- `crm.objects.deals.read` / `.write` - Deal management
- `crm.objects.owners.read` - View team members
- `crm.schemas.contacts.read` - Read object schemas

**Service Scopes:**
- `tickets` - Ticket management

**Marketing Scopes:**
- `content` - Content and email management

<Tip>
  Permissions are requested at connection time. You can review and manage connected apps in your HubSpot settings under **Integrations** → **Connected Apps**.
</Tip>

## Rate Limits

HubSpot API has rate limits based on your subscription:

| Plan | API Calls/Day | Burst Limit |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Free | 250,000 | 100/10s |
| Starter | 500,000 | 100/10s |
| Professional | 1,000,000 | 150/10s |
| Enterprise | Custom | 200/10s |

<Warning>
  Batch operations are more efficient and count as fewer API calls. Use them when working with multiple records.
</Warning>
