**NimbleBrain Studio** is a powerful web-based platform for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, workspaces, and AI integrations. Deploy and configure MCP servers with a visual interface, no command line required.

## What is NimbleBrain Studio?

NimbleBrain Studio is a web-based platform that provides visual management for MCP servers and AI-powered workflows:

- **Playbooks**: Create and manage AI-powered workflows with natural language instructions
- **Toolbox**: Install and manage MCP servers from the community registry
- **Visual Workspace Management**: Create, switch, and manage isolated workspace environments
- **Integrated Monitoring**: Track execution history, view logs, and monitor activity
- **API Tokens**: Generate secure tokens for programmatic access and Claude Desktop integration

## Studio vs CLI

Both Studio and the [NimbleTools CLI](/cli/introduction) provide access to the same platform capabilities:

| Feature | Studio | CLI |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Workspace Management** | ✅ Visual UI | ✅ Command line |
| **MCP Server Management** | ✅ One-click install | ✅ Single command |
| **Playbooks** | ✅ Visual workflow builder | ❌ Not available |
| **Monitoring & Logs** | ✅ Real-time dashboard | ✅ Stream to terminal |
| **Claude Integration** | ✅ Generate tokens | ✅ Generate config |
| **Automation** | ✅ Scheduled playbooks | ✅ CI/CD pipelines |
| **Best For** | Workflows, visual monitoring | Scripts, automation, power users |

<Callout type="tip">
  **Use Both!** Most users find a hybrid approach works best - use Studio for visual management and monitoring, and CLI for automation and scripts.
