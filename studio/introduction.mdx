## Studio vs CLI

Both Studio and the [NimbleTools CLI](/cli/introduction) provide access to the same platform capabilities:

| Feature | Studio | CLI |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Workspace Management** | ✅ Visual UI | ✅ Command line |
| **Server Deployment** | ✅ One-click | ✅ Single command |
| **Monitoring & Logs** | ✅ Real-time dashboard | ✅ Stream to terminal |
| **Claude Integration** | ✅ Copy config | ✅ Generate config |
| **Automation** | ❌ Not available | ✅ CI/CD pipelines |
| **Best For** | Quick setup, visual monitoring | Scripts, automation, power users |

<Callout type="tip">
  **Use Both!** Most users find a hybrid approach works best - use Studio for visual management and monitoring, and CLI for automation and scripts.
