# Welcome to NimbleBrain Studio

NimbleBrain Studio is a web-based platform for building AI-powered automations. Create workflows that leverage MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to connect to external APIs, databases, and services.

<Note>
**First time here?** NIRA, our AI assistant, can help you get started by building your first automation through conversation. Or explore the platform and build manually!

## Studio vs CLI

Both Studio and the [NimbleTools CLI](/cli/introduction) provide access to the same platform capabilities:

| Feature | Studio | CLI |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Automation Building** | ✅ Visual UI + NIRA assistant | ❌ Not available |
| **Workspace Management** | ✅ Visual UI | ✅ Command line |
| **MCP Server Management** | ✅ One-click install | ✅ Deploy command |
| **Playbooks** | ✅ Create & manage | ❌ Not available |
| **Monitoring & Logs** | ✅ Real-time dashboard | ✅ Stream to terminal |
| **Claude Integration** | ✅ Generate tokens | ✅ Generate config |
| **Best For** | Building and managing automations | CI/CD, scripting, power users |

<Tip>
  **Use Both!** Studio provides a visual interface for building and managing automations, while the CLI is perfect for CI/CD pipelines and scripting.
