## Studio vs CLI

Both Studio and the [NimbleTools CLI](/cli/introduction) provide access to the same platform capabilities:

| Feature | Studio | CLI |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Automation Building** | ✅ Visual UI + Nira assistant | ❌ Not available |
| **Workspace Management** | ✅ Visual UI | ✅ Command line |
| **Connection Management** | One-click install | Deploy command |
| **Playbooks** | ✅ Create & manage | ❌ Not available |
| **Monitoring & Logs** | ✅ Real-time dashboard | ✅ Stream to terminal |
| **Claude Integration** | ✅ Generate tokens | ✅ Generate config |
| **Best For** | Building and managing automations | CI/CD, scripting, power users |

<Tip>
  **Use Both!** Studio provides a visual interface for building and managing automations, while the CLI is perfect for CI/CD pipelines and scripting.
