**Activity Logs** (also called Audit Logs) provide a complete audit trail of all actions taken within your workspace, helping you track changes, debug issues, and maintain security compliance.

## What are Activity Logs?

Activity Logs record every significant action in your workspace:

- **Workspace Changes**: Creation, deletion, and configuration updates
- **Playbook Activity**: Creation, updates, and executions
- **Toolbox Actions**: Server installations, uninstalls, and restarts
- **API Token Management**: Token creation and deletion
- **User Actions**: Who performed each action and when
