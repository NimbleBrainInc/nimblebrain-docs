Workspaces provide isolated environments for organizing playbooks, MCP servers, and API tokens.

## What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are isolated containers that include:

- **Playbooks**: AI-powered workflows with natural language instructions
- **Connections**: Installed MCP servers and their configurations
- **API Tokens**: Authentication tokens unique to each workspace
- **Activity Logs**: Audit trail of all workspace actions
- **AI Credits**: Usage tracking and billing per workspace

<Callout type="tip">
  Think of workspaces like separate projects or environments (dev, staging, production).

## Workspace Tokens

Generate tokens for CLI and API access:

### Token Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard Token">
    - Expires after 30 days
    - Used for CLI authentication
    - Can be refreshed
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Long-Lived Token">
    - Expires after 1 year
    - Used for CI/CD pipelines
    - Cannot be refreshed (must be regenerated)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Read-Only Token">
    - View-only access to workspace
    - Cannot deploy or modify servers
    - Used for monitoring integrations
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Generating Tokens

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Token Management">
    Navigate to Settings → API Tokens
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Token">
    Click **Generate Token** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Token">
    - Select token type

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Store tokens securely. Anyone with a token can access your workspace!
</Callout>

### Using Tokens with CLI

```bash
# Set the token as an environment variable
export NTCLI_TOKEN=your-workspace-token

# Or use the login command
ntcli auth login --token your-workspace-token

# Verify authentication
ntcli auth status
```

## Deleting Workspaces

- ✅ Notify team members with access
- ✅ Revoke all workspace tokens

## Workspace Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Separate Environments">
    Create distinct workspaces for development, staging, and production. This prevents accidental changes to production servers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Descriptive Naming">
    Use clear names like `company-app-prod` or `john-experiments` to quickly identify workspace purposes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Least Privilege Access">
    Grant team members the minimum role necessary. Use Viewer role for stakeholders who only need visibility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Token Rotation">
    Rotate workspace tokens every 30-90 days. Revoke old tokens after rotation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Resource Usage">
    Regularly check resource quotas to ensure you have headroom for growth.
  </Accordion>
