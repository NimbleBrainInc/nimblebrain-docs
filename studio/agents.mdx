# Agents

Agents are intelligent orchestrators that manage multiple playbooks simultaneously, enabling complex multi-step workflows that span different tools and data sources.

<Note>
**Think of it this way:**
- **Playbook** = Single automation task (e.g., "fetch weather")
- **Agent** = Coordinator of multiple tasks (e.g., "morning routine: fetch weather, check calendar, send daily brief")
</Note>

## What is an Agent?

An Agent is a smart container that:
- 🎯 **Orchestrates Multiple Playbooks** - Run several automations as one cohesive workflow
- ⏰ **Scheduled Execution** - Run all playbooks at specified times or intervals
- 🔄 **Sequential or Parallel** - Control how playbooks execute (one after another or simultaneously)
- 📊 **Unified Monitoring** - Track all playbook executions in one place
- 🤖 **NIRA-Powered** - Build complex agents through conversation

## Agent vs Playbook

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Playbook" icon="book">
    **Single automation task**

    - One specific workflow
    - Uses one or more integrations
    - Runs independently
    - Example: "Send Slack notification"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Agent" icon="robot">
    **Multi-playbook orchestrator**

    - Coordinates multiple playbooks
    - Manages complex workflows
    - Scheduled or interval-based
    - Example: "Daily morning routine"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to Use Agents

Use Agents when you need to:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coordinate Multiple Data Sources">
    **Example:** Pull data from Salesforce, enrich with market data from Finnhub, analyze with AI, and post results to Slack

    **Why Agent:** Multiple playbooks working together, each handling one data source
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Execute Sequential Workflows">
    **Example:** Morning routine - check weather → check calendar → check emails → generate daily brief → send to Slack

    **Why Agent:** Playbooks need to run in specific order, passing data between steps
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Recurring Multi-Step Processes">
    **Example:** Hourly: monitor system health → check API quotas → update dashboard → alert if issues

    **Why Agent:** Complex workflow that repeats on a schedule
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conditional Workflow Branching">
    **Example:** Sales pipeline: check new leads → qualify leads → assign to reps → notify team, but only for qualified leads

    **Why Agent:** Logic spans multiple playbooks with conditional execution
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating an Agent with NIRA

The easiest way to create an agent is to ask NIRA:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your Multi-Step Workflow">
    Tell NIRA about the complex automation you want to build

    <Card>
    **You:** "I need a morning routine agent that checks the weather, pulls my calendar for today, summarizes my emails, and sends me a daily brief in Slack every weekday at 7am"
    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="NIRA Analyzes & Proposes Structure">
    NIRA identifies this needs multiple playbooks and suggests an agent

    <Card>
    **NIRA says:** 🤖

    "Perfect! This is a great use case for an Agent. I'll create a 'Morning Routine Agent' with 4 playbooks:

    1. **Weather Playbook** - Fetches forecast for your location
    2. **Calendar Playbook** - Gets today's events from Google Calendar
    3. **Email Playbook** - Summarizes unread emails
    4. **Brief Playbook** - Compiles everything and sends to Slack

    These will run sequentially so each step completes before the next starts.

    Schedule: Weekdays at 7:00 AM

    Sound good?"
    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure API Keys">
    Provide credentials for each service the agent will use
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Agent Configuration">
    See all playbooks, their execution order, and schedule
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy & Monitor">
    Agent goes live and you can track each playbook execution
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent Configuration

### Scheduling Options

Agents can be configured with flexible scheduling:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Time-Based">
    Run at specific times:
    - Daily at 9:00 AM
    - Weekdays at 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM
    - Every Monday at 10:00 AM
    - First day of month at 9:00 AM

```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "type": "time",
    "time": "09:00",
    "days": ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"],
    "timezone": "America/Panama"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Interval-Based">
    Run at regular intervals:
    - Every 15 minutes
    - Every hour
    - Every 6 hours
    - Every day

```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "type": "interval",
    "interval": "1h",
    "startTime": "08:00"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Event-Triggered">
    Run when conditions are met:
    - When webhook receives data
    - When file is uploaded
    - When threshold is exceeded

```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "type": "trigger",
    "trigger": "webhook",
    "endpoint": "/webhooks/agent-123"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Execution Modes

Control how playbooks within an agent execute:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sequential" icon="arrow-right">
    Playbooks run one after another

    **Best for:**
    - Dependent steps
    - Data flows between playbooks
    - Resource-intensive tasks

    **Example:** Fetch data → Process → Analyze → Report
  </Card>

  <Card title="Parallel" icon="diagram-project">
    Playbooks run simultaneously

    **Best for:**
    - Independent tasks
    - Speed optimization
    - Multiple data sources

    **Example:** Check 5 APIs at once, compile results
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Playbook Dependencies

Define relationships between playbooks:

```json
{
  "playbooks": [
    {
      "id": "fetch-sales-data",
      "name": "Fetch Sales Data",
      "dependencies": []
    },
    {
      "id": "fetch-market-data",
      "name": "Fetch Market Data",
      "dependencies": []
    },
    {
      "id": "analyze-data",
      "name": "Analyze Combined Data",
      "dependencies": ["fetch-sales-data", "fetch-market-data"]
    },
    {
      "id": "send-report",
      "name": "Send Report to Team",
      "dependencies": ["analyze-data"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent didn't run on schedule">
    **Check:**
    - Agent is not paused
    - Schedule timezone is correct
    - Schedule cron expression is valid
    - System status page for outages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One playbook failed, stopped entire agent">
    **Solution:**
    - Configure error handling to "continue" instead of "stop"
    - Add retry logic to the failing playbook
    - Review playbook logs to fix underlying issue
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Playbooks running in wrong order">
    **Check:**
    - Execution mode (sequential vs parallel)
    - Playbook dependencies are configured correctly
    - Review execution logs for actual order
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent runs too slowly">
    **Optimize:**
    - Switch independent playbooks to parallel execution
    - Reduce API call frequency in playbooks
    - Cache frequently-accessed data
    - Review tool performance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
