# Scheduling

Scheduling allows your playbooks to run automatically at specified times or intervals without manual intervention. Set up daily reports, hourly monitors, or event-triggered workflows that run reliably in the background.

<Note>
**Quick Setup:** Tell Nira "Run this every morning at 9am" and she'll configure the schedule automatically. Press **⌘K** to get started.
</Note>

## Schedule Types

NimbleBrain Studio supports three types of scheduling:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Time-Based" icon="clock">
    Run at specific times (daily at 9am, weekdays at 8am)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interval-Based" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Run at regular intervals (every 15 minutes, hourly)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event-Triggered" icon="bolt">
    Run when webhooks receive data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Time-Based Scheduling

Run playbooks at specific times on specific days.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Examples">
    - **Daily at 9:00 AM** - Morning reports
    - **Weekdays at 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM** - Start and end of day summaries
    - **Every Monday at 10:00 AM** - Weekly reports
    - **First day of month at 9:00 AM** - Monthly summaries
    - **Last Friday of month at 4:00 PM** - End of month reviews
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Configuration">
```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "type": "time",
    "time": "09:00",
    "days": ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"],
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Setting Up with Nira

Just describe when you want your playbook to run:

<Card>
**You:** "Create a sales report that runs every weekday at 8am Eastern time"

**Nira:** "I'll create a playbook that queries your CRM data and sends a summary. It will run Monday through Friday at 8:00 AM Eastern. Would you like me to set that up?"
</Card>

## Interval-Based Scheduling

Run playbooks at regular intervals throughout the day.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Examples">
    - **Every 15 minutes** - Real-time monitoring
    - **Every hour** - Hourly status checks
    - **Every 6 hours** - Periodic data sync
    - **Every 24 hours** - Daily batch processing
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Configuration">
```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "type": "interval",
    "interval": "1h",  // Options: 15m, 30m, 1h, 6h, 24h
    "startTime": "08:00"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Interval values:** `15m` (15 min), `30m` (30 min), `1h` (hourly), `6h` (6 hours), `24h` (daily)

### Setting Up with Nira

<Card>
**You:** "Monitor our API endpoints every 15 minutes and alert me if response time exceeds 2 seconds"

**Nira:** "I'll create a monitoring playbook that checks your endpoints every 15 minutes. If any endpoint takes longer than 2 seconds to respond, I'll send you an alert via Slack. Sound good?"
</Card>

## Event-Triggered Scheduling

Run playbooks when external events occur via webhooks.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Examples">
    - **New customer signup** - Welcome email workflow
    - **Support ticket created** - Triage and routing
    - **Payment received** - Invoice processing
    - **File uploaded** - Document processing
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Configuration">
```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "type": "trigger",
    "trigger": "webhook",
    "endpoint": "/webhooks/playbook-abc123"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Setting Up with Nira

<Card>
**You:** "When a new customer signs up in Stripe, send them a welcome email and create a ticket in Zendesk"

**Nira:** "I'll set up a webhook that triggers when Stripe detects a new subscription. The playbook will send a personalized welcome email and create a customer success ticket. I'll provide you with the webhook URL to configure in Stripe."
</Card>

## Managing Schedules

### Viewing Scheduled Playbooks

All scheduled playbooks appear in your Playbooks list with a clock icon. You can see:

- **Next run time** - When the playbook will execute next
- **Last run time** - When it last executed
- **Status** - Active, paused, or failed

### Pausing & Resuming

Temporarily disable a schedule without deleting the playbook:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pause" icon="pause">
    Stop scheduled runs temporarily (e.g., during maintenance or holidays)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resume" icon="play">
    Restart scheduled runs when ready
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

To pause or resume, either:
- Click the pause/play button in the Playbooks list
- Tell Nira: "Pause my morning report playbook"

### Modifying Schedules

Update a schedule anytime:

<Card>
**You:** "Change my sales report to run at 7am instead of 8am"

**Nira:** "Done! Your sales report playbook will now run at 7:00 AM Eastern on weekdays."
</Card>

## Timezone Handling

All schedules run in the timezone you specify. If no timezone is set, your workspace's default timezone is used.

<Tip>
**Tip:** When creating playbooks with Nira, include the timezone in your request: "Run this at 9am Pacific" or "8am Eastern time"
</Tip>

Supported timezone formats:
- `America/New_York`
- `America/Los_Angeles`
- `Europe/London`
- `Asia/Tokyo`
- And all standard IANA timezone names

## Error Handling

When a scheduled playbook fails:

1. **Automatic Retry** - Failed runs retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. **Error Notification** - You're notified via your configured channels
3. **Execution Log** - Full details available in Activity Logs
4. **Schedule Continues** - Future scheduled runs are not affected

### Configuring Retries

```json
{
  "errorHandling": {
    "retry": true,
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "retryDelay": "5m",
    "onError": "continue"
  }
}
```

Options:
- `continue` - Keep running future scheduled executions
- `pause` - Pause the schedule after repeated failures
- `notify` - Send additional alerts on failure

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose the Right Schedule Type">
    - **Time-based** for reports, summaries, and scheduled communications
    - **Interval-based** for monitoring, syncing, and polling
    - **Event-triggered** for real-time responses to external actions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Timezone Impact">
    If your playbook affects users in multiple timezones, consider:
    - Running at a time that works across regions
    - Creating separate playbooks for different regions
    - Using UTC for internal processes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Avoid Peak Times">
    For non-urgent playbooks, avoid running during peak hours:
    - Spread out batch processing throughout the day
    - Run heavy reports during off-hours
    - Stagger similar playbooks to avoid conflicts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Before Scheduling">
    Always run a playbook manually first:
    1. Verify it produces expected output
    2. Check that notifications reach the right destinations
    3. Confirm API connections are working
    4. Then enable the schedule
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Initially">
    For new scheduled playbooks:
    - Watch the first few runs closely
    - Check Activity Logs for any issues
    - Adjust timing or configuration as needed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Patterns

### Morning Briefing

<Card>
**Schedule:** Weekdays at 7:00 AM

**Playbook:** Fetch weather, calendar events, and top news headlines. Compile into a summary and send to Slack.

**Tell Nira:** "Create a morning briefing that sends me weather, my calendar, and top tech news every weekday at 7am"
</Card>

### Hourly System Health Check

<Card>
**Schedule:** Every hour

**Playbook:** Check API endpoints, database performance, and error logs. Alert if issues detected.

**Tell Nira:** "Monitor our production API every hour and alert #engineering if response times exceed 1 second"
</Card>

### Weekly Report

<Card>
**Schedule:** Every Monday at 9:00 AM

**Playbook:** Aggregate last week's metrics from CRM, support tickets, and usage data. Generate PDF report and email to leadership.

**Tell Nira:** "Create a weekly report every Monday that summarizes our sales pipeline and support metrics from HubSpot and Zendesk"
</Card>

### Real-Time Customer Onboarding

<Card>
**Schedule:** Webhook trigger from Stripe

**Playbook:** When new subscription is created, send welcome email, create CRM record, and notify success team.

**Tell Nira:** "When a new customer signs up in Stripe, send them a welcome email and add them to HubSpot"
</Card>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Playbook didn't run on schedule">
    **Check:**
    - Playbook is not paused
    - Schedule timezone is correct
    - Look for errors in Activity Logs
    - Verify API credentials haven't expired
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Playbook runs at wrong time">
    **Solution:**
    - Verify timezone setting
    - Check if daylight saving time affected the schedule
    - Update the schedule with explicit timezone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too many executions">
    **Solution:**
    - Review interval settings (15m vs 1h)
    - Add conditions to skip unnecessary runs
    - Consider time-based instead of interval scheduling
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missed runs during outage">
    **Note:**
    - NimbleBrain does not backfill missed runs
    - Schedule resumes normally after service restoration
    - Check Activity Logs for execution history
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
