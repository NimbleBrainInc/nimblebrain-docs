**Playbooks** are AI-powered workflows that automate complex tasks using natural language instructions. They execute using Claude AI and can leverage any connections installed in your workspace.

<Note>
**New Way to Build**: Instead of creating playbooks manually, most users now build them conversationally with [Nira](/studio/nira). This page explains what playbooks are and how to edit them.
</Note>

<Info>
**Understanding the Hierarchy:**
- **Nira** builds and manages playbooks → [Meet Nira](/studio/nira)
- **Playbooks** (you are here) are individual automation tasks
- **Connections** are the integrations playbooks use → [Browse Connections](/studio/connections)
- **Scheduling** automates recurring playbooks → [Set up Schedules](/studio/scheduling)
</Info>

## What are Playbooks?

Playbooks allow you to:

- **Automate workflows** with natural language instructions
- **Use integrations** installed via Connections to access external APIs and services
- **Track execution history** with detailed logs and results
- **Schedule runs** or trigger them manually
- **Configure AI parameters** like model, temperature, and timeouts

## Creating Playbooks with Nira

The easiest way to create a playbook is to ask Nira in the sidebar. Simply describe what you want to automate and Nira will build the playbook for you.

/>

### Example: Git Repository Email Alert

In this example, we asked Nira:

> "Could you make me a new playbook to send me an email whenever my git repo is updated?"

Nira automatically:
- Created a new playbook with appropriate instructions
- Selected the necessary tools (GitHub for monitoring, email for notifications)
- Generated the natural language instructions for the playbook
- Configured the playbook settings

You can then review, modify, and deploy the playbook that Nira created. This conversational approach is much faster than manually configuring everything.

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: Be specific about timing, triggers, and outputs when asking Nira. For example: "Check my main branch every hour" or "Send emails to admin@company.com"
</Tip>

## Creating a Playbook Manually

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Playbooks">
    Click "Playbooks" in the sidebar navigation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click New Playbook">
    Click the "New Playbook" button in the top right
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Playbook Details">
    Provide a name and description for your playbook
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Instructions">
    Write natural language instructions describing what the playbook should do
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Create" to save your playbook
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Playbooks have access to all connections installed via the Connections page. Make sure to install the necessary connections first!
</Callout>

## Playbook Instructions

<img
  src="/images/studio/playbooks-example.png"
  alt="Playbook instructions"
/>

Instructions are written in natural language and tell the AI what to do. Be specific about:

- **What data to gather**: Which APIs or tools to use
- **How to process it**: Any transformations or analysis needed
- **What to output**: The format and content of the result

### Example Instructions

```
You are a stock advisor given the reports provided by Finnhub.
You ingest articles from Finnhub and recommend the top 3 stocks
expected to provide the greatest returns over the next week.
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Natural Language Instructions**: Write instructions as if you were explaining the task to a human. The AI will interpret and execute them using available tools.
</Callout>

## Playbook Configuration

<img

  alt="Playbook configuration"
/>

Configure how your playbook executes:

<ResponseField name="Status" type="toggle">
  Enable or disable the playbook. Disabled playbooks cannot be executed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Model" type="select">
  The Claude model to use for execution (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Temperature" type="number">
  Controls randomness (0.0-1.0). Lower values are more focused and deterministic.
  - **0.0-0.3**: Precise, factual tasks
  - **0.4-0.7**: Balanced (default: 0.7)
  - **0.8-1.0**: Creative, exploratory tasks
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Max Tokens" type="number">
  Maximum tokens for the response (default: 4096)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Timeout" type="number">

</ResponseField>

## Running a Playbook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Playbook">
    Click on a playbook from the list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Run">
    Click the green "Run" button in the top right
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Execution">
    Watch the execution progress in real-time
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Results">
    See the execution result and any tool calls made
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
  Playbooks execute asynchronously. You can navigate away and check the results later in the Recent Executions tab.
</Callout>

## Recent Executions

<img
  src="/images/studio/playbook-execution.png"
  alt="Playbook recent executions"
/>

The Recent Executions tab shows a history of all playbook runs:

- **Execution status**: Completed, failed, or in progress
- **Timestamp**: When the playbook was executed
- **Duration**: How long the execution took
- **Executor**: Who triggered the execution
- **Detailed steps**: Expand to see reasoning, tool calls, and results

### Execution Details

Each execution shows:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Executed By">
    The user who triggered the execution and their email address
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start Time & Duration">
    When the execution started and how long it took to complete
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Instructions">
    The natural language instructions that were executed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Execution Result">
    The final output from the AI, including any recommendations or findings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Execution Steps">
    A detailed breakdown of each step:
    - **Reasoning**: The AI's thought process
    - **Tool Calls**: Which tools were invoked
    - **Results**: The output from each step
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Scheduling Playbooks

Playbooks can run on a schedule for automated, recurring execution. Schedules use **cron expressions** to define when playbooks run.

### Creating a Schedule

You can create schedules through:
1. **Nira**: "Run this playbook every day at 8am"
2. **UI**: Click "Schedule" in the playbook settings
3. **API**: POST to `/api/workspaces/:id/schedules`

### Cron Expression Format

Schedules use standard cron syntax with 5 fields:

```
┌───────────── minute (0-59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0-6, Sunday=0)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Common Schedule Examples

| Schedule | Cron Expression | Description |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Every hour | `0 * * * *` | At minute 0 of every hour |
| Daily at 8am | `0 8 * * *` | Every day at 8:00 AM |
| Daily at 8am & 6pm | `0 8,18 * * *` | Twice daily |
| Weekdays at 9am | `0 9 * * 1-5` | Monday through Friday at 9 AM |
| Every Monday at 9am | `0 9 * * 1` | Weekly on Monday |
| First of month at 6am | `0 6 1 * *` | Monthly on the 1st |
| Every 15 minutes | `*/15 * * * *` | At 0, 15, 30, 45 minutes |
| Every 6 hours | `0 */6 * * *` | At 0, 6, 12, 18 hours |

### Timezone Support

All schedules support timezone configuration. Set the timezone to ensure your playbook runs at the expected local time:

- `America/New_York` - Eastern Time
- `America/Los_Angeles` - Pacific Time
- `Europe/London` - UK Time
- `Asia/Tokyo` - Japan Time
- `UTC` - Coordinated Universal Time

<Tip>
Always specify a timezone to avoid confusion with daylight saving time changes.
</Tip>

### Schedule Settings

<ResponseField name="Skip if Previous Running" type="toggle">
  Don't start a new execution if the previous one is still running. Prevents overlap for long-running playbooks.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Max Concurrent Executions" type="number">
  Maximum number of simultaneous executions (default: 1). Increase for playbooks that can safely run in parallel.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Auto-Pause on Failures" type="number">
  Automatically pause the schedule after N consecutive failures. Prevents runaway failures.
</ResponseField>

### Schedule Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Schedule is running normally |
| **Paused** | Schedule is temporarily stopped (manual or auto) |
| **Error** | Schedule paused due to consecutive failures |

### Managing Schedules
