**Playbooks** are AI-powered workflows that automate complex tasks using natural language instructions. They execute using Claude AI and can leverage any MCP servers installed in your Toolbox.

## What are Playbooks?

Playbooks allow you to:

- **Automate workflows** with natural language instructions
- **Use MCP tools** installed in your Toolbox to access external APIs and services
- **Track execution history** with detailed logs and results
- **Schedule runs** or trigger them manually
- **Configure AI parameters** like model, temperature, and timeouts

## Creating a Playbook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Playbooks">
    Click "Playbooks" in the sidebar navigation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click New Playbook">
    Click the "New Playbook" button in the top right
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Playbook Details">
    Provide a name and description for your playbook
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Instructions">
    Write natural language instructions describing what the playbook should do
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Create" to save your playbook
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Playbooks have access to all MCP servers installed in your Toolbox. Make sure to install the necessary servers first!
</Callout>

## Playbook Instructions

<img

  alt="Playbook instructions"
/>

Instructions are written in natural language and tell the AI what to do. Be specific about:

- **What data to gather**: Which APIs or tools to use
- **How to process it**: Any transformations or analysis needed
- **What to output**: The format and content of the result

### Example Instructions

```
You are a stock advisor given the reports provided by Finnhub.
You ingest articles from Finnhub and recommend the top 3 stocks
expected to provide the greatest returns over the next week.
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Natural Language Instructions**: Write instructions as if you were explaining the task to a human. The AI will interpret and execute them using available tools.
</Callout>

## Playbook Configuration

  alt="Playbook configuration"

Configure how your playbook executes:

<ResponseField name="Status" type="toggle">
  Enable or disable the playbook. Disabled playbooks cannot be executed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Model" type="select">
  The Claude model to use for execution (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Temperature" type="number">
  Controls randomness (0.0-1.0). Lower values are more focused and deterministic.
  - **0.0-0.3**: Precise, factual tasks
  - **0.4-0.7**: Balanced (default: 0.7)
  - **0.8-1.0**: Creative, exploratory tasks
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Max Tokens" type="number">
  Maximum tokens for the response (default: 4096)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Timeout" type="number">
  Maximum execution time in seconds (default: 300)
</ResponseField>

## Running a Playbook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Playbook">
    Click on a playbook from the list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Run">
    Click the green "Run" button in the top right
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Execution">
    Watch the execution progress in real-time
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Results">
    See the execution result and any tool calls made
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
  Playbooks execute asynchronously. You can navigate away and check the results later in the Recent Executions tab.
</Callout>

## Recent Executions

  alt="Playbook recent executions"
/>

The Recent Executions tab shows a history of all playbook runs:

- **Execution status**: Completed, failed, or in progress
- **Timestamp**: When the playbook was executed
- **Duration**: How long the execution took
- **Executor**: Who triggered the execution
- **Detailed steps**: Expand to see reasoning, tool calls, and results

### Execution Details

Each execution shows:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Executed By">
    The user who triggered the execution and their email address
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start Time & Duration">
    When the execution started and how long it took to complete
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Instructions">
    The natural language instructions that were executed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Execution Result">
    The final output from the AI, including any recommendations or findings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Execution Steps">
    A detailed breakdown of each step:
    - **Reasoning**: The AI's thought process
    - **Tool Calls**: Which MCP tools were invoked
    - **Results**: The output from each step
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Playbook Status

Playbooks can have the following statuses:
