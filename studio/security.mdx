---

NimbleBrain is designed with security at its core. We understand that your automations often involve sensitive business data, and we take that responsibility seriously.

## Our Approach to Data

<Callout type="info" title="We Don't Train on Your Data">
  Your business data is never used to train AI models. NimbleBrain orchestrates and automates your workflows, but we don't learn from your information.
</Callout>

### How NimbleBrain Handles Data

NimbleBrain acts as an **orchestration layer** between your tools. Here's what that means:

| What We Do | What We Don't Do |
|------------|------------------|
| Connect to your integrations via OAuth or API keys | Store your raw data long-term |
| Execute automation workflows you define | Train AI models on your data |
| Log activity for audit purposes | Share data between customers |
| Cache data temporarily during execution | Sell or monetize your data |

When Nira runs an automation, data flows through NimbleBrain to reach its destination (like sending an email or updating a CRM record), but we don't retain that data beyond what's needed for execution and logging.

## Infrastructure

NimbleBrain runs on trusted cloud infrastructure with industry-standard security practices.

### Cloud Providers

We leverage major cloud providers (AWS) for hosting, which provide:

- Physical security at data centers
- Network isolation and firewalls
- Regular security audits and compliance certifications
- Redundancy and high availability

### Encryption

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="In Transit" icon="lock">
    All connections to NimbleBrain use TLS encryption. Your data is encrypted as it travels between your browser, our servers, and your connected tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credentials" icon="key">
    OAuth tokens and API keys are encrypted before storage. We never store credentials in plain text.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Access Controls

NimbleBrain provides role-based access control (RBAC) to help you manage who can do what within your organization.

### User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access including billing, team management, and workspace deletion |
| **Admin** | Manage playbooks, connections, and team members |
| **Member** | Create and run playbooks, manage own connections |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to playbooks and activity logs |

### Organization Features

- **Team Management**: Invite team members and assign appropriate roles
- **Workspace Isolation**: Separate environments for different projects or teams
- **API Token Scoping**: Generate tokens with specific permissions for integrations

<Callout type="tip">
  Follow the principle of least privilege: grant team members only the access they need to do their work.
</Callout>

## Audit Logging

Every action in NimbleBrain is logged for accountability and troubleshooting.

### What We Log

- Playbook executions (start time, status, duration)
- Connection changes (added, removed, updated)
- Team member actions (invites, role changes)
- API token usage
- Login events

### Accessing Logs

Activity logs are available in the Studio dashboard under **Activity**. You can filter by:

- Date range
- Action type
- User
- Playbook

## Connection Security

When you connect third-party services to NimbleBrain, we use secure authentication methods.

### OAuth Connections

For services that support OAuth (like Slack, Google, HubSpot):

- We never see or store your password
- You authorize NimbleBrain directly with the service
- You can revoke access at any time from the service's settings
- Tokens are encrypted at rest

### API Key Connections

For services using API keys:

- Keys are encrypted before storage
- Keys are never displayed in full after initial entry
- You can rotate keys at any time

<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful when sharing API keys. Anyone with a key may have access to that service. Use NimbleBrain's built-in connection management rather than sharing keys directly.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Strong Authentication">
    Enable two-factor authentication on your NimbleBrain account and on the services you connect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Connected Services">
    Periodically review your connections and remove any you no longer use.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Manage Team Access">
    Remove team members who no longer need access. Use appropriate roles for each person.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate API Tokens">
    Regularly rotate API tokens, especially for production workspaces.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Activity Logs">
    Check activity logs periodically for unexpected actions or access patterns.
