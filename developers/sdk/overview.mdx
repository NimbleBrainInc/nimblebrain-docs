The NimbleBrain SDK provides a clean, type-safe interface for building applications that interact with NimbleBrain Studio. Use it to programmatically chat with Nira, run playbooks, and create conversational interfaces.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @nimblebrain/sdk
```

Or with your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @nimblebrain/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @nimblebrain/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @nimblebrain/sdk
```
</CodeGroup>

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { NimbleBrain } from '@nimblebrain/sdk';

// Initialize the SDK with your API key
const nb = new NimbleBrain({ apiKey: 'nb_live_...' });

// Create a conversation with Nira
const conversation = await nb.nira.conversations.create('My chat session');

// Stream the response in real-time
for await (const event of nb.nira.messages.stream(conversation.id, 'Hello!')) {
  if (event.type === 'content') {
    process.stdout.write(event.data.text as string);
  }
}

// Or run a playbook
const result = await nb.playbooks.invoke('playbook-id');
console.log('Playbook result:', result);
```

## SDK Structure

The SDK is organized into namespaces that mirror the NimbleBrain Studio concepts:

| Namespace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `nb.nira` | Chat with Nira (conversations, messages, streaming) |
| `nb.playbooks` | List and execute playbooks |
| `nb.executions` | Track playbook execution status |
| `nb.connections` | Manage workspace connections |

## When to Use the SDK

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Building Custom Chat Interfaces">
    Create your own chat UI that connects to Nira. The streaming API provides real-time responses for a smooth user experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Backend Automation">
    Run playbooks programmatically from your backend services. Integrate NimbleBrain automations into your existing workflows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CI/CD Pipelines">
    Trigger playbooks as part of your deployment process. For example, run a playbook that notifies your team after each deployment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom Applications">
    Build internal tools that leverage NimbleBrain's AI capabilities without using the Studio UI.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18.0 or later (for native fetch support)
- **API Key** from NimbleBrain Studio

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to [NimbleBrain Studio](https://studio.nimblebrain.ai?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=developers)
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy the key (it starts with `nb_live_` or `nb_test_`)

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure. Never commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code.
